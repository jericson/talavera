# Talavera

Talavera is an 18-card game inspired by Azul.

Players compete to decorate a flight of stairs according to customer
specifications.

## Components

Print [the cards](cards.pdf) double-sided on card stock or
single-sided to put in card sleeves.

One side represents an **order card**. Each of the four colors has a
number, which represents the customer's order for that type of tile.

The other side of the cards have four squares (**tiles**) grouped by
color. Players will take turns drafting these cards in order to
fulfill their customer's order.

## Two player rules

Talavera consists of 4 rounds of two phases. Shuffle the cards and
give each player an order card. Randomly decide on a first player for
the first round. Each round, swap who drafts first so that each player
drafts first twice over the course of the game.

### Draft phase

Deal four cards in the center of the table with the order side up. The
first player flips two cards and selects one to keep. The second
player flips the other two cards and selects one of the three cards
remaining in the market.

Players take turns drafting one card until the market is empty. Each
player will have two cards to place.

### Placement phase

When you have two cards, you must decide which color tiles to
keep. Tuck each card under one corner of the order card to show which
color of tile was placed. Be sure to leave the corresponding tiles
visible.

> **Note**: Only the tiles of that color count toward your score. 

You may place both cards on the same color or different colors. You
may also add tiles to a color you have already placed. You must add a
card to a color represented by at least one tile on that card.

Continue drafting and placing tiles until all the cards are gone and
both players have covered all four orders. (Don't forget to swap who
drafts first!)

### Winning

When all the cards have been drafted and both players have all four
corners covered, the game is over and each player evaluates how well
they completed the orders.

In order to fill an order, there must be _at least_ as many tiles of
that color as indicated by the number on the order. Score each order
separately and add up the total score.

* Each fulfilled order is 3 points.
* Subtract 1 point for each excess tile. Orders can't go below 0.
* If there are fewer of a color than required, the order is worth 0 points.

> **Example**: The first order is for 3 yellow tiles. The player placed
> 4 yellow tiles, so they completed the order with one excess
> tile. That order is worth 2 points (3 - 1). 
>
> The next order is for 2 red tiles, but the player didn't place any
> red tiles on the order. That's worth 0 points because the order
> wasn't fulfilled.
>
> The third order was for 4 sky blue tiles and the player had exactly
> that. It's worth 3 points for fulfilling the order exactly.
> 
> Finally the 1 azure (dark blue) tile was ordered. The player placed
> 5 tiles of that color and scored 3 points for filling the order and
> lost 4 points for excess tiles. Since the score for an order can
> never go below zero, it scores 0 points.

Add the total score for all four orders and highest score wins.

In case of a tie, congratulate each other on a job well done!


## Solo rules

As in the two-player game, solo Talavera consists of 4 rounds of two
phases. However, instead of completing specific orders, the goal is to
decorate a flight of stairs with 4 different colors. Ignore the
numbers on the order card.

### Draft phase (solo)

Shuffle the deck and place the solo rules on top to cover the top
card. Deal two cards from the bottom of the deck with their tile
side face up. Select one card and discard the other. Repeat the
process with two more cards so that you have a two tile cards to place.

**Once per game**: Instead of taking one of a pair of cards, discard
both cards and randomly draw a card from the deck to keep. 

### Placement phase (solo)

**Unlike the two-player game**, cover one corner of the order card with
all the tile cards you selected that round. However, you may place
cards on a corner that does not have a corresponding tile.

> **Example**: If you have a card with one red tile and the other has
> no red tiles, you may place both cards on the red corner to claim
> one red tile. 


You may ignore the order number in the solo game. As long as you have
sets (1, 2, 3, and 4) of four different colors, you can win the game.

### Winning (solo)

The only way to win is to place sets of _exactly_ 1, 2, 3, and 4
tiles of different colors.

If you place _any_ excess tiles, you have lost the game.

> **Example**: Starting the fourth and final draft phase, you have
> placed 2 yellow, 3 reds, and 4 azure tiles. In order to win, you
> must draft exactly 1 sky blue tiles.

**Extra special win**: place _exactly_ the customer's order according
to the numbers on the order card. (Warning: this involves quite a bit
of luck!)


## Design notes

I designed this game for the second [Decision Space
Jam](https://www.decisionspacepodcast.com/decisionspacejam) â€” 18
Cards. Talavera was inspired by [my all-time favorite
game](https://jlericson.com/2023/10/02/top10.html),
[Azul](https://jlericson.com/2020/01/04/azul-review.html). I've tried
to maintain the design principles that I like best from Michael
Kiesling's classic:

1. **Open information**: All players see the same things on the table.
2. **Interactive draft**: Each time a player selects tiles, it alters
   the state of the draft for other players. Players can manipulate
   the market to ensure their own plans succeed or to thwart the plans
   of other players.
3. **Placement puzzle**: Deciding where to place tiles changes the
   relative value of tiles in future drafts. A partially completed
   color represents a risk that the color might not be available when
   your next turn to draft comes.
4. **Efficiency rewarded**: Nothing feels better than filling a color
   exactly. Nothing feels worse than being forced to take excess tiles
   that drop to the floor.
   
Dan R, on the Decision Space Discord server, helped me solve some of
the problems I originally had with the draft. He suggested putting
tiles on all 18 cards to avoid card counting. He also came up with the
idea for giving the first player to draft a choice of two cards
instead of all four.

I'm considering an explicit cooperative mode. One of the things I like
about Azul is that people naturally play in the interest of their own
goals without worrying too much about other players. Cutthroat play
comes with experience. 

Based on player feedback, I added a simple scoring system to encourage
a more relaxed way to play. It's still a zero sum game, but scoring
makes it possible to lose by a small amount. Often a close game feels
better for the loser than a binary win or lose end state.


Drafting games resist a satisfying solo mode. There is [a fan-made solo
mode for
Azul](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/164052/soloplay-azul-v1pdf),
but Azul shines when another player's decisions impact yours. A puzzly
solo mode that takes 5 minutes from setup to completion seems like
a decent accomplishment.

Speaking of which, I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to make
my card representation of tiles enjoyable to arrange on the table. I
took inspiration from the splaying mechanism of Innovation to design
the tile cards. An early version of the game required splaying tiles,
but the current version allows players to fiddle with their cards as
much or as little as they like.

I'm not entirely happy with the simple color squares. I used [Talavera
tiles](https://www.lafuente.com/Mexican-Decor/Talavera-Pottery/Talavera-Tile/)
to decorate our front steps. (See the image at the top of this page.)
At some point I might replace the solid squares with authentic tile
designs. This would have the added advantage of avoiding problems for
colorblind players.

<!--
In Talavera, all information is open so the market can be manipulated to force your opponent to take cards they don't want or leave cards you need. Even though it's a 5 minute game, there are strategic considerations for placing tiles.

---

Talavera is an 18-card game inspired by Azul. Players compete to decorate a flight of stairs according to customer specifications. Each player starts with a unique set of orders that must be completed to score points.

Players take turns drafting tile cards from the market. After taking two cards, they decide which color of tiles to place. If they include excess tiles, they pay a penalty during final scoring.

Talavera takes about 5 minutes. Each choice requires evaluating not just your own position, but your opponent's situation as well. 

Talavera also includes a solo mode in which you must decorate the stairs without wasting any tiles. For an extra challenge, complete a predetermined order card.
