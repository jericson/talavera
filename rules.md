Players compete to decorate a flight of stairs with decorative tiles
according to customer specifications.

## Components

One side of each card represents an **order card**. Each of the four
colors has a number, which represents the customer's order for that
type of tile. The other side of the cards have four squares
(**tiles**) grouped by color. Players will take turns drafting these
cards in order to fulfill their customer's order.

## Two player rules

Talavera consists of 4 rounds of two phases. Shuffle the cards and
give each player an order card. Randomly decide on a first player for
the first round. Each round, swap who drafts first so that each player
drafts first twice over the course of the game.

### Draft phase

Deal four cards in the center of the table with the order side up. The
first player flips two cards and selects one to keep. The second
player flips the other two cards and selects one of the three cards
remaining in the market. Players take turns drafting one card until
the market is empty. Each player will have two cards to place.

### Placement phase

When each player has two cards, they must pick which color to
keep. Place the cards so that they cover one corner of the order card
to show which color of tile was placed.

> **Note**: Only the tiles of that color count toward your score. 

Continue drafting and placing tiles until all the cards are gone and
both players have covered all four orders. (Don't forget to swap who
drafts first!)

### Winning

When all the cards have been drafted and both players have all four
corners of their order card covered, evaluate how well you completed
orders. To fill an order, there must be _at least_ as many tiles of
that color as indicated by the number on the order.

* Each fulfilled order is 3 points.
* Subtract 1 point for each excess tile. Orders can't go below 0.
* If there are fewer of a color than required, the order is worth 0 points.

> **Example**: The first order is for 3 yellow tiles. The player placed
> 4 yellow tiles, so they completed the order with one excess
> tile. That order is worth 2 points (3 - 1). 
>
> The next order is for 2 red tiles, but the player didn't place any
> red tiles on the order. That's worth 0 points because the order
> wasn't fulfilled.
>
> The third order was for 4 sky blue tiles and the player had exactly
> that. It's worth 3 points for fulfilling the order exactly.
> 
> Finally the 1 azure (dark blue) tile was ordered. The player placed
> 5 tiles of that color and scored 3 points for filling the order and
> lost 4 points for excess tiles. Since the score for an order can
> never go below zero, it scores 0 points.

Add the total score for all four orders and highest score wins. In
case of a tie, congratulate each other on a job well done!


## Solo rules

As in the two-player game, solo Talavera consists of 4 rounds of two
phases. However, instead of completing specific orders, the goal is to
decorate a flight of stairs with 4 different colors. Ignore the
numbers on the order card.

### Draft phase (solo)

Shuffle the deck and place the solo rules on top to cover the top
card. Deal two cards from the bottom of the deck with their tile
side face up. Select one card and discard the other. Repeat the
process with two more cards so that you have a two tile cards to place.

**Once per game**: Instead of taking one of a pair of cards, discard
both cards and randomly draw a card from the deck to keep. 

### Placement phase (solo)

As in the two-player game, cover one corner of the order card with the
tiles of that color.


**Unlike the two player game**: ignore the order number. As long as
you have sets (1, 2, 3, and 4) of four different colors, you can win
the game.

### Winning (solo)

The only way to win is to place sets of _exactly_ 1, 2, 3, and 4 tiles
of different colors. If you place _any_ excess tiles, you have lost
the game.

> **Example**: Starting the fourth and final draft phase, you have
> placed 2 yellow, 3 reds, and 4 azure tiles. In order to win, you
> must draft exactly 1 sky blue tiles.

**Extra special win**: place _exactly_ the customer's order according
to the numbers on the order card. (Warning: this involves quite a bit
of luck!)
